Since then cryptocurrencies have been used as a store of value, fuel in an ecosystem, or used as securities. With these new mix purpose functionalities, MooPay believes that it is important that cryptocurrencies should all inherently have a digital cash capability and have the ability to be spent. The first transaction was actually quite expensive and maybe was a catalyst of fear of not to spend cryptocurrencies in the infamous pizza bitcoin purchase. One of the first major companies to build the bridge in spending Bitcoin was BitPay. BitPay first enabled merchants to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment to shop on their stores. The second product BitPay launched was the BitPay Visa Card that enables their users to load a Visa debit card with fiat funds converted from Bitcoin building the first payment instrument that enables spending cryptocurrencies. BitPay helped realize Satoshi\u2019s original intentions with Bitcoin and it enabled a cash system to be used via a traditional Visa card and between merchants who wanted to process bitcoin as a payment method."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Since the launch of these two products from BitPay, many companies are now attempting to launch products aimed to make cryptocurrencies more easily accessible and useable in our real world.
