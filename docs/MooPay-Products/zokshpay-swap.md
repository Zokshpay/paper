# ZokshPay Swap
---

ZokshPay Swap is an automated marketing making (AMM) protocol that allows users to swap tokens/coins on-chain from Ethereum and other popular chains (through bridges) and earn trading fees in exchange for providing liquidity.
The originating suppliers will establish pricing, which will fluctuate based on open markets. On the protocol, liquidity providers will earn a 0.26 percent trading fee for providing on-chain liquidity, with 0.05 percent allocated to burn Zoksh on-chain.
ZokshPay Swap will develop and deploy several cross-chain bridges for digital asset trading based on an EVM compatible protocol, allowing users to trade across multiple blockchains without relying on a central party.
