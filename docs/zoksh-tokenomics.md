# Zoksh Tokenomics and Emission
---

The ZokshPay Token (Zoksh) is the fuel for the ZokshPay ecosystem of products and services. It is also its native cryptocurrency. The token economics have been constructed in such a way that as the network is used, the overall supply of tokens reduces over time.

50% of all Zoksh tokens will be burnt over time, as there is more network usage and fee collection.
